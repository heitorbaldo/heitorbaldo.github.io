Hi! My name is Heitor Baldo and I hold a B.S. in Mathematics and a M.S. in Applied Mathematics, both from the [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/en), and a Ph.D. in Mathematical Neuroscience from the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/). 
My research consists of adapting advanced mathematical methods to study different areas of neuroscience. More specifically, I am interested in how highly abstract and advanced fields of mathematics, such as abstract algebra, combinatorics, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, discrete geometry, sheaf theory, graph theory, category theory, tropical algebra, and tropical geometry, can be useful in network neuroscience (functional and effective connectivity networks), neural coding, computational cognitive science (memory, learning, and behavior), brain-computer interface (BCI), and computational neuroscience in general. This includes the incorporation of artificial intelligence methods (topological deep learning and reinforcement learning) both in the analysis of neural data and in the study of the interplay between AI and neuroscience. Also, I am interested in multiscale brain modeling, mainly through the AdS/Brain correspondence. I've been applying some of these new methods to the study of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, mainly from EEG and fMRI data. I am always looking for new ideas and possibilities.
