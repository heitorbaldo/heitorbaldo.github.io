## About me

Hi! My name is Heitor Baldo and I hold a BS in Mathematics and an MS in Applied and Computational Mathematics both from the [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/en) and a PhD in Bioinformatics (Mathematical Neuroscience) from the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/). Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Leipzig University](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en). I have experience in the areas of mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, and bioinformatics, with an emphasis on mathematical neuroscience. More specifically, I am interested in the mathematical foundations of methods coming from various areas of pure and applied mathematics, such as abstract algebra, combinatorics, algebraic topology and geometry, discrete geometry, graph theory, category theory, complex systems, and complexity science, and how these methods, together with probabilistic, statistical, and computational methods, can be useful in mathematical neuroscience and mathematical biology.

## Research Interests

### Mathematical Theories

* Computational algebraic topology and geometry;
* Discrete and combinatorial geometry (discrete (higher-order) structures; discrete curvatures; finite geometries);

* Matroid theory (oriented matroids; (hyper)graphic matroids); 
* Network statistics;
* Applied category theory;
* Complexity science (complexity measures; quantitative emergence);
* Multiscale complex systems.


### Applications
