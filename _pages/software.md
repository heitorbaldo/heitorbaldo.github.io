## Python Packages

* [DigplexQ](https://github.com/heitorbaldo/DigplexQ) - DigplexQ is a Python package to perform computations with digraph-based complexes (directed flag complexes and path complexes). It is an "adjacency matrix-centered" package since it was designed so that the user can perform all computations just by entering an adjacency matrix as input. Current version: v0.0.7 (PyPi). Soon available for Julia (DigplexQ.jl).
* [PyTropical](https://github.com/heitorbaldo/PyTropical) - PyTropical is a Python package for tropical mathematics. Current version: v0.0.2 (PyPi).


## Julia Packages

* DigplexQ.jl - Julia version of the DigplexQ Python package (Soon).


## Jupyter Notebooks

* [Notes on Computational Neuroscience]() - These notebooks are a compilation of algorithms of models of spiking neurons: Izhikevich model, AdEx model, LIF models.
* [Topics on Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging]() - These notebooks are a compilation of algorithms of deep learning models for the analysis of fMRI, EEG, and MEG data.

## Papers with Code

* Directed Q-Analysis and Directed Higher-Order Adjacencies on Digraphs: A Quantitative Approach, 2024 (expected).

## Docker Container Images

* DigplexQ Docker Container Image (Docker container image).
